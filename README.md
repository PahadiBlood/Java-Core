Multithreading in Java refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a Java program. A thread is a lightweight sub-process that runs independently, allowing a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multithreading is a fundamental feature of Java and is used to achieve better performance and responsiveness in applications, particularly in scenarios where tasks can be parallelized or need to run concurrently.

Here are some key concepts and features related to multithreading in Java:

Thread Class: In Java, multithreading is primarily achieved by using the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. You can create threads by extending the Thread class or by passing a Runnable object to a Thread constructor.

Thread States: Threads in Java can be in various states, including NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED. These states represent different stages of a thread's lifecycle.

Thread Synchronization: Multithreading can lead to issues like race conditions and data inconsistency when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently. Java provides mechanisms like synchronized blocks and methods to synchronize access to critical sections of code, ensuring that only one thread can execute them at a time.

Thread Priorities: Java allows you to assign priorities to threads using integer values ranging from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Thread priorities can influence the order in which threads are scheduled for execution by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but they are not guaranteed to be strictly followed.

Thread Pooling: Creating a large number of threads can be resource-intensive. Java provides libraries like the Executor framework, which allows you to create and manage a pool of reusable threads, making it more efficient to execute tasks concurrently.

Thread Safety: Ensuring thread safety is crucial when working with multithreaded Java applications. You should use proper synchronization mechanisms and design patterns to prevent data corruption and race conditions.
